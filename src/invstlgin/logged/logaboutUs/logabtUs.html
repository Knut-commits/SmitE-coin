    <div id="founderinfo">Meet Smit, the brain behind it all. Born and raised in India, he’s a master of turning big ideas into reality — usually while sipping chai and cracking a joke. He’s always thinking outside the box, but if you ever need a fresh perspective on a problem, he’s got you covered with both tech skills and a great sense of humor!</div>
    <div id ="inspo">We started with the idea of creating a Dogecoin-inspired cryptocurrency, but then we realized – why not make it more personal? So, we renamed it SmitEcoin after our founder, Smit, an Indian entrepreneur who wanted something unique. It’s still fun, quirky, and a little cheeky – just with a twist that’s all us!</div>
